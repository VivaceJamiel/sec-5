To start, I had to figure out how to make an SSH server using paramiko
I start with the docs and found out I need to use the Transport class to make the server itself
I then wrote code to set up a server but ran into some troubles
I tries using ssh-keygen to generate a key but it didn't work
I then used paramiko's function to generate an RSA key and had it save to a file in the directory, and it worked
I then used the key to create a server but then ran into trouble trying to make an ssh terminal
Trying to figure out how to get the server to respond to commands was a challenge but following the documents I was able to get the commands that the user is sending to the server
The next task was to make file system for the server to use.
I used pathlib to create a directory for the server to use and then created a file system for the server to use
The directory the server uses is the 'dir' directory and it is made at the start if it doesn't exist and the server moves to it at the beginning
